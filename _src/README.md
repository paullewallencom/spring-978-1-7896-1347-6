**Build and deploy Java microservices using Spring Cloud, Istio, and Kubernetes**

## What is this book about?
Microservices architecture allows developers to build and maintain applications with ease, and enterprises are rapidly adopting it to build software using Spring Boot as their default framework. With this book, you’ll learn how to efficiently build and deploy microservices using Spring Boot.


This book covers the following exciting features:
* Build reactive microservices using Spring Boot 
* Develop resilient and scalable microservices using Spring Cloud 
* Use OAuth 2.0/OIDC and Spring Security to protect public APIs 
* Implement Docker to bridge the gap between development, testing, and production 
* Deploy and manage microservices using Kubernetes 
* Apply Istio for improved security, observability, and traffic management

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
management.endpoint.health.show-details: "ALWAYS"
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include: "*"

logging.level.root: info
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for Java and Spring developers and architects who want to learn how to break up their existing monoliths into microservices and deploy them either on-premises or in the cloud using Kubernetes as a container orchestrator and Istio as a service Mesh. No familiarity with microservices architecture is required to get started with this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter03-20).
### Software and Hardware List

## Get to Know the Author
**Magnus Larsson** has been in the IT industry for more than 30 years, working as a consultant for large companies in Sweden such as Volvo, Ericsson, and AstraZeneca. He has seen a lot of different communication technologies come and go over the years, such as RPC, CORBA, SOAP, and REST. In the past, he struggled with the challenges associated with distributed systems as there was no substantial help from the software available at that time. This has, however, changed dramatically over the last few years with the introduction of open source projects such as Spring Cloud, Netflix OSS, Docker, and Kubernetes. Over the last five years, Magnus has been helping customers use these new software technologies and has also done several presentations and blog posts on the subject.
